# My Portfolio Website

### Just a simple Website
Welcome to my simple, hopefully visually appealing portfolio website. I started coding a year ago, and this site is a showcase of my journey and skills.
As you'll notice, it's still a work in progress. As I continue to explore and grow in my journey, I'll be adding more projects.  I love creating designs that are both easy to use and nice to look at.
